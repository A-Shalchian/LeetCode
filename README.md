## How to Use

### Problem Solutions

Each problem solution is contained in its own directory, often with a README explaining the problem statement and approach. To run the solutions:

#### JavaScript Solutions
```bash
node [path-to-solution-file].js
```

#### Java Solutions
```bash
java -cp [path-to-class-file] [ClassName]
```

### Tutorials
